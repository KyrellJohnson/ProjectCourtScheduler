TO DO LIST

*High Priority*
!Create a way to read and write to a JSON file in a format consisting of:
{
	"members":[	
		{
			"MemID": "1023",
			"ResTime": "1200",
			"ResDateMonth": "11",
			"ResDateDay":	"10",
			"ResDateYear":	"2018",
			"ResCourtNum":	"5"
		},

		{
			#same format as above
			...
			...
			...
		}
	]
}

!Similar file as above to store member ID assosiated penalty points
	#Could be stored as an list/dictionary possible, with memberID as key
	#and penalty points as value

!A way to visualize the schedule of reservations
	#might want to look into a table of dates in a specified order
	#might need to make this either searchable or scrollable
	#follow documentation for windows forms capabilities

!A cancel in reservation should delete that from the JSON file
	#error handling where if file does not exist create one, but without overwriting

!User Access
	#make it so if there is another reservation in same time and court that there
	#is a way to override this, and overwriting whats in the JSON file
	#*LOW PRIORITY*add This functionality towards the end

!Confirmation Screen
	#Have the same list (table) of reservations with ability to select and confirm
	#which pushes this reservation through fully

!Member Lookup
	*LOW PRIORITY*
	#doesnt have to be complicated, have the program fetch the data where
	#it reads the penalty points from a given ID
