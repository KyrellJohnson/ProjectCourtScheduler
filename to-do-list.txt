TO DO LIST

*High Priority*
[FINISHED]Create a way to read and write to a XML file in a format consisting of:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

-<CurrentReservations>
	-<Reservation>
		<memID>1001</memID>
		<Court>96</Court>
	</Reservation>
	-<Reservation>
		<memID>101</memID>
		<Court>108</Court>
	</Reservation>
	-<Reservation>
		<memID>105</memID>
		<Court>105</Court>
	</Reservation>
</CurrentReservations>

!Similar file as above to store member ID assosiated penalty points
	#Could be stored as an list/dictionary possible, with memberID as key
	#and penalty points as value

!A way to visualize the schedule of reservations
	#might want to look into a table of dates in a specified order
	#might need to make this either searchable or scrollable
	#follow documentation for windows forms capabilities

!A cancel in reservation should delete that from the XML file
	#error handling where if file does not exist create one, but without overwriting

!User Access
	#make it so if there is another reservation in same time and court that there
	#is a way to override this, and overwriting whats in the file
	#*LOW PRIORITY*add This functionality towards the end

!Confirmation Screen
	#Have the same list (table) of reservations with ability to select and confirm
	#which pushes this reservation through fully

!Member Lookup
	*LOW PRIORITY*
	#doesnt have to be complicated, have the program fetch the data where
	#it reads the penalty points from a given ID
